Potato Leaf Disease Predication by CNN
Welcome to the Potato Leaf Disease Prediction repository! Here, you'll find a complete set of tools for predicting potato leaf diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in Python.

To make the process of training and evaluating the models easier, we've integrated the "Potato Leaf Diseases" dataset from Kaggle right into this repository. This dataset contains a wide array of images, some showing healthy potato leaves and others showing leaves affected by various diseases. You can access this dataset directly from a file in our repository.

Inside this repository, you'll discover the entire set of instructions and code needed to predict potato leaf diseases. This covers everything, from preparing the data, constructing and training the CNN model, to assessing how well it performs. Through training on the provided dataset, our CNN model becomes skilled at recognizing unique patterns and characteristics associated with two  types of potato leaf diseases.

Additionally, we've included a PowerPoint presentation that thoroughly explains the code and showcases the results we've achieved. This presentation serves as a valuable resource for gaining a deeper insight into how our approach works, and the overall performance of the model.
